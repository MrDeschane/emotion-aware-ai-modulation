## Overview

This project proposes a modular architecture for advanced conversational AI systems that dynamically adapts tone, memory precision, and topic coherence using real-time emotional and semantic cues.

The system introduces layered components that work in harmony to improve stability, insight delivery, and long-session engagement, including:

- **Emotional Weight Scoring (EWS)**
- **Responsiveness Calibration (RCC)**
- **Drift Tolerance Thresholding (DTT)**
- **Memory Clarity Filtering (MCF)**
- **Hidden Outcome Architecture (HOA)**
- **Adaptive Recovery Scheduling (ARS)**
- **Cognitive Elevation and Self-Realization Model (CESRM)**

All modules are orchestrated by a **Meta-Control Layer (MCL)** for coherent response balance, adaptive pacing, and self-correction.

## Call to Action

This system is ready for experimental integration and community validation.  
Contributions, discussion, and adaptation into real-time LLM workflows are encouraged.

If you're an AI researcher, developer, or systems designer interested in exploring salience-based memory, modular insight regulation, or multi-thread drift control — you're invited to collaborate.
